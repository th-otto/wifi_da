(Atari ST version)
Written by Thorsten Otto

BlueSCSI Wi-Fi DA is free software; see the LICENSE file for copyright/licensing

To install, just copy the accessory to the root of your boot partition.
There should now be a Wi-Fi option in the AES menu.

Alternatively, it can also be started from the desktop (but that makes
only sense on multitasking systems like MiNT or MagiC).
